                <h3>A little about zoos</h3>
                <p> There are many zoos around the world. Zoos have can be traced back over 5000 years! They were used
                    as a
                    way to display their wealth, power , and intelligance.
                    The worlds oldest zoos is Schönbrunn Zoo. It was established in 1752 and is still in operation.
                    Today, the main purpose of zoos are for entertainment and economic purposes. While entertaining the
                    public, zoos also aim to educate us about the animals,
                    scientific reasearhc and species conservation. that they have gathered there.
                    Zoos generate billions of dollars a year and a portion of their revenue go towards wild life
                    conservation.</p>

            <section class="2">
                <h3>A little about me</h3>
                <p>One Zoo that I used to frequent as a child was Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, MA. It is the only zoo
                    that I
                    have ever been too.
                    I remember walking through the entrance and walking around to see as many animals as I could. My
                    favorite animals were always the big cats,
                    but they always looked so sad or aggitated so I stopped going to the Zoo. As I grew older, I began
                    believed that animals should be rescued,
                    taken care of and set free back into the wild. Not in captivity. And that sentiment has stuck with
                    me
                    ever since. I believe that with the proper care and procedured, some zoos can do some sort of good
                    but there needs
                    to be reform.</p>

                <h3>What caught my attention</h3>
                <p> Throughtout this project, I have leaerned that a large portion of the a zooz revenue is aimed
                    towards wild life conservation, education, Staff salaries,
                    Animal maintenance, Facilities costs, Advertising, and Fundraising. Wild life conservation stood out
                    to me because I always thought they helped injured
                    animals just to put them in zoos. It is good to know that they are also helping the animals, their
                    habitats and the environment as a whole through wildlife conservation</p>

                <span class="asideTitle">The problems with zoos </span>
                Zoos exist primarily because humans want to look at animals close up, in a way that is both cheap and
                convenient.
                This is seldom admitted, instead their main purpose is claimed to be for the preservation of endangered
                species and for education.
                Protecting animals in their natural habitats, and teaching children about animals in a better way in
                schools,
                would be better solutions than keeping wild animals in cages. In some cases a breeding program in
                captivity
                might be necessary,
                but in those cases the animals should not be exhibited to the public. Allowing spectators to come close
                to
                wild animals in captivity often causes stress,
                which can impair the success of breeding.(1)

                <span class="asideTitle">Behavioural disturbances </span>
                Living in a zoo deprives animals of their freedom and entails several threats to their health and
                wellbeing.
                Confined spaces and insufficient amounts of stimuli can lead to stereotypical behaviours, in other
                words,
                behavioural disturbances.
                For instance, rocking from side to side, pacing or walking in circles. This can affect animals who
                cannot
                exhibit their natural behaviours in captivity,
                such as animals belonging to species that roam across vast areas in the wild, like elephants(2) or
                dolphins.

                In addition, many of the species of animals kept at zoos in Nordic countries are adapted to a completely
                different climate than the one they are kept in.
                Because of this, these animals are kept inside during the winter season, further limiting their
                environment.(3, 4) Examples of species like this are
                elephants and chimpanzees.

                <span class="asideTitle">Recurring scandals </span>
                Almost every year at least one scandal occurs at one of the zoos in the country you live in. It can be
                anything from animals escaping,
                named individuals killed in cold blood or zookeepers killed by the animals in their care. During 2022
                the
                scandals in Sweden were so many t
                hat it led to large investigations in the media,(5) where Project 1882 was able to make comments on what
                changes need to be made.
                The execution of the endangered chimpanzees Santino, Manda, Torsten and Linda in December 2022, has
                prompted
                more people to question
                the societal value of zoos. Long before his death, Santino had begun protesting against visitors looking
                at
                him – by throwing rocks at them.(6)
